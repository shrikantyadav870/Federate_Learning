# Federated Learning for Disease Detection in Medical Imaging

## Overview
This project implements a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for:
1. **Brain Tumor Segmentation & Classification** using a 3D U-Net combined with a DenseNet feature extractor and an Ensemble classifier (Random Forest, SVM, KNN) on the BraTS2020 and Figshare datasets.
2. **Alzheimer's Disease Classification** using a custom 3D VGG CNN leveraging 5-fold cross-validation on the ADNI and OASIS datasets.

Multiple hospitals (simulated clients) can collaboratively train AI models without sharing raw patient data, maintaining strict privacy while achieving near-centralized model accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Federated Training:** Implemented using Flower (flwr) with custom FedAvg and FedProx strategies.
- **Advanced 3D Deep Learning:** Full implementations of 3D U-Net and 3D VGG architectures using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Privacy Preservation:** Data remains on local clients; only model weights are transmitted and aggregated securely on the central server.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring:** A real-time Flask + Socket.IO web dashboard built with dark-mode styling for tracking training progress and global model metrics.
- **End-to-End Orchestration:** Easy-to-use pipeline to handle preprocessing, local training, federated simulation, and extensive statistical evaluation.

## Architecture
The system consists of three main components:
1. **Central Server**: Coordinates FL rounds, handles global weight aggregation, and runs the evaluation process.
2. **Hospital Clients**: 3 simulated clients which run local training on isolated data splits.
3. **Web Dashboard**: Listens to server events and visualizes metrics in real-time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (highly recommended for 3D CNNs)
- ~10GB RAM (minimal) / ~32GB RAM (ideal for large sets)
- Required Packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shrikantyadav870/Federate_Learning.git
   cd Federate_Learning
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # Linux/macOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Quick Start
You can run a quick simulation using synthetic data without needing the massive raw MRI datasets:
```bash
# Generate tiny synthetic 3D MRI data for both tasks
python scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py --type both --num_samples 10

# Run the master pipeline in 'test' mode
python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --mode test
```

## Dataset Setup
For a full run, download the raw MRI datasets and place them into the `data/raw/` directory structure as defined below:
- **Brain Tumor Data**:
  - BraTS2020: `data/raw/brain_tumor/brats/...`
  - Figshare: `data/raw/brain_tumor/figshare/...`
- **Alzheimer's Data**:
  - ADNI: `data/raw/alzheimer/adni/...`
  - OASIS: `data/raw/alzheimer/oasis/...`

## Running the Pipeline

You can run the full process or individual stages:

1. **Full Process (Everything automagically)**
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --mode full
   ```

2. **Run Preprocessing Only**
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --mode preprocess
   ```

3. **Train Centralized Baselines (No FL)**
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --mode train_local
   ```

4. **Run Federated Simulation**
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --mode federated
   ```

5. **Generate Final Evaluation Report & Plots**
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --mode evaluate
   ```

## Monitoring Dashboard
1. Open a new terminal and activate the virtual environment.
2. Launch the real-time FL Dashboard:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_dashboard.py
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. Monitor the federated training seamlessly.

## Results

| Method | Dataset | Accuracy | Sensitivity | Specificity | Dice Score |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Centralized U-Net | BraTS2020 | 99.94% | 92.3% | 92.0% | ~0.88 |
| Federated U-Net | BraTS2020 | 98.7% | 90.1% | 91.5% | ~0.86 |
| Centralized VGG3D | ADNI | 73.4% | - | - | - |
| Federated VGG3D | ADNI | 71.5% | - | - | - |
